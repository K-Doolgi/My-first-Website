        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="blank" title="Java script이란 무엇인가">JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/)</a>, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.</p>
        <img src="javascript.jpg" width="1280" height="720">
        <p> As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries.<br> 
            All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.<br>
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.<br>
            It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.<br>
            It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br>
            The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications.<br>
            The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.<br>
            Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
